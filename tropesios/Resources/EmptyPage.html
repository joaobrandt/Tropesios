            <em>What is this about?</em> This wiki is a catalog of the tricks of the trade for writing fiction.

            <a href="tvtropeswiki:Main/Trope">Tropes</a> are devices and conventions that a writer can reasonably rely on as being present in the audience members' minds and expectations. On the whole, tropes are not <a href="tvtropeswiki:Main/Cliche">clichés</a>. The word clichéd means "stereotyped and trite." In other words, dull and uninteresting. We are not looking for dull and uninteresting entries. We are here to recognize tropes and play with them, not to make fun of them.
        </p>

            The wiki is called "TV Tropes" because TV is where we started. Over the course of a few years, our scope has crept out to include other media. Tropes transcend television. They reflect life. Since a lot of art, especially the popular arts, do their best to reflect life, tropes are likely to show up everywhere.

            We are not a stuffy encyclopedic wiki. We're a <em>buttload</em> more informal. We encourage breezy language and original thought. <a href="tvtropeswiki:Administrivia/ThereIsNoSuchThingAsNotability">There Is No Such Thing As Notability</a>, and no citations are needed. If your entry cannot gather any evidence by the <a href="tvtropeswiki:Main/WikiMagic">Wiki Magic</a>, it will just wither and die. Until then, though, it will be available through the <a href="tvtropeswiki:Main/Tropes">Main Tropes Index</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are also not a wiki for bashing things. Once again, we're about <em>celebrating</em> fiction, not showing off how snide and sarcastic we can be.
        </p>

            Enough about what we are not. Go on, have a look at the <a href="tvtropeswiki:Main/WelcomeToTVTropes">welcome page</a>, and have fun!
